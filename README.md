*Spring Boot Application with User Authentication and Authorization*
This is a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates user creation, authentication, and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Features
User Creation: Users can create an account by providing their email and password. The password is securely hashed and stored in the database.
User Authentication: Users can authenticate by providing their email and password. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned.
Authorization with JWT: Protected routes can be accessed by providing the JWT token in the request headers. The token is verified to ensure the user has the necessary permissions.
